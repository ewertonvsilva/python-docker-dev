# python-docker-dev 
Use this setup to develop a python code running in a container, without having to redeploy the container on every code change.


```
git clone https://github.com/ewertonvsilva/python-docker-dev.git
docker-compose up
```

You can edit the `mysource.py` file and see the changes happening on realtime on the output.
